    <h3>Mohinga, the Burmese fish noodle</h3>
    <p>Mohinga is the national dish of Myanmar and is a traditional 
        fish-based noodle soup that is usually enjoyed for breakfast 
        but can be eaten any time of day. It features a flavorful broth made 
        from fish, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, onions, and spices like turmeric, 
        and is served with rice noodles and a variety of toppings such as boiled egg, 
        cilantro, crispy fried onions, lime, and sometimes fried fritters or banana stem. 
        Mohinga is commonly found at street stalls and is loved for its savory, hearty, 
        and aromatic qualities.</p>
