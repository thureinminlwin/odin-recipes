    <h4>Shan Noodle</h4>
    <p>Shan noodle is a popular Burmese dish originating from Myanmar’s Shan State, 
        made with soft rice noodles topped with a savory tomato-based sauce, usually 
        containing chicken or pork, and garnished with pickled mustard greens, peanuts, 
        garlic oil, and fresh herbs. The dish can be served dry—with sauce coating the 
        noodles—or as a soup with a light, aromatic broth, offering a comforting balance of savory, 
        tangy, and slightly sweet flavors. Shan noodle is known for its unique combination 
        of soft noodles, rich sauce, and fresh, crunchy toppings.</p>
