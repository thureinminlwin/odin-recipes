    <h4>Laphat Thoke, Burmese pickled tea leaf salad</h4>
    <p>Laphat thoke, also known as Burmese tea leaf salad, 
        is a traditional dish from Myanmar made with fermented or pickled
         tea leaves as its key ingredient. The tea leaves are mixed with crunchy
          elements like fried beans, roasted peanuts, sesame seeds, garlic chips,
           and fresh vegetables such as shredded cabbage and tomatoes. 
           This salad is typically seasoned with lime juice, fish sauce or soy sauce,
            chili, and a drizzle of oil, resulting in a tangy, savory, umami-rich, 
            and texturally complex dish. Laphat thoke is often served as a snack or 
            appetizer during meals and holds cultural importance in Myanmar.</p>
